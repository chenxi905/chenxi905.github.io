<p>A big component of that vision was improving market access for Alberta crude by building support for new pipeline infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Approving tarsands pipelines like Energy East and Kinder Morgan, which is what this strategy appears to do, would lock in high carbon emissions and make it practically impossible for Canada to reach its climate reduction targets,&#8221; said Dale Marshall, national program manager with Environmental Defence.</p>
<p>But Calgary energy company TransCanada criticized Marshall&#8217;s view.</p>
